    "text": "Upon learning that he had past relatives who owned various businesses and sugar cane plantations, our founder at the age of 17 had the bright idea to start his own aged rum company. Years later he began working on the family business which was originally doing bookkeeping for guests at Jines Villa. He decided to expand this business by introducing Jinterros. He came up with the name combining his fathers and mothers last name. Jines and Terrero together became Jinterros."

    "text": "He tried many different rums from the Caribbean. Learning about the process and understanding what truly made rum premium. The rum he presented to his family was an exquisitely smooth blend of golden caramel, a hint of coconut and mango infused with aged rum from the Dominican Republic."

    "title": "The Dream",
    "text": "Later on the founder began working on the bottle that would store our rum. After many attempts at creating a bottle and logo for the brand he decided to rest for the night. On that night a dream occurred in which the bottle presented itself. He recalls a woman calling his name and telling him to follow her. As he continued to chase the voice he stumbled upon the bottle. It's in glory, standing proud and tall. It was three in the morning when he woke up from the dream and immediately began sketching the bottle. That is how Jinterros got its beautiful and polished look!"
