    "text": "Before Jines Villa was built it was a massive piece of land owned by a wealthy German settler who immigrated to the Dominican Republic in 1939. He eventually sold it off. Later on expansions were made in 1979 for a summer home that was formerly owned by a Dominican general. “El general” towns folk have called him. When Mr. and Mrs Jines found that the property was for sale they acquired it to make it a new home for family and friends. Years later it has become a summer and winter destination. Not only for the family but for many former guests and those to come."
